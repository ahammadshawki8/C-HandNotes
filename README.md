# C HandNotes
My practise file when I was learning how to code in C. Some resources which helped me a lot:
- freeCodeCamp's C full course.
- C notes for professionals.
- CodeForces problem sets.

# How to use
Although I haven't documented the code blocks extensively, if you are a beginner who wants to learn C languages, then you can go through these files, maybe copy-paste some code snippets.
